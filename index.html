                <p class="lead">Serbian-American engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) made dozens of breakthroughs in the production,
                    transmission and application of electric power. He invented the first alternating current (AC) motor
                    and developed AC generation and transmission technology. Though he was famous and respected, he was never
                    able to translate his copious inventions into long-term financial success—unlike his early employer and
                    chief rival, Thomas Edison.

                <ol>
                    <li class="p-2">His long-abandoned Long Island laboratory will soon become a museum. Earlier this year, a non-profit
                        organization raised enough money to purchase the long-abandoned Wardenclyffe. The group plans to
                        restore the building and turn it into a Tesla museum and science education center.</li>
                    <li class="p-2">Tesla was not a savvy businessman and suffered financially, despite his achievements. He lost financial
                        backing from Morgan, who felt he couldn’t profit from Tesla’s wireless electricity concept, and sold
                        his assets to make up for dual foreclosures on Wardenclyffe. The property was later sold to a film
                        processing company. In 1917, the U.S. government demolished Tesla’s partially completed tower because
                        it worried German spies would use it to intercept communications during World War I.</li>
                    <li class="p-2">In 1901, Tesla received financial backing from J. Pierpont Morgan to build his Wardenclyffe laboratory
                        in Shoreham, Long Island. The facility included the “Tesla Tower,” a 185-foot high structure with
                        a 65-foot copper dome transmitter on the top. Tesla’s vision was to use the tower to transmit signals
                        and free, unlimited wireless electricity all over the world. Thanks to Tesla's early work, wireless
                        transfer of energy is finally being realized today -- from wireless chargers for electric toothbrushes
                        and smartphones, to wireless electric vehicle charging, a technology being researched at the Energy
                        Department’s National Labs.</li>
                    <li class="p-2"> “Teslas,” a unit used to measure the strength of magnetic fields, are named after Tesla. Another namesake
                        is Tesla Motors, the electric car start-up, in homage to Tesla’s role in the invention of the electric
                        motor.
                    </li>
                    <li class="p-2">Tesla designed the first hydroelectric power plant in Niagara Falls, New York, harnessing the power of
                        the waterfalls he had marveled at since childhood. Construction took three years and power first
                        flowed to homes in nearby Buffalo on Nov. 16, 1896. A statue of Tesla on Goat Island overlooks the
                        falls today.</li>
                    <li class="p-2">During the war of the currents, alternating current (AC) -- favored by Tesla -- battled for wide acceptance
                        with direct current (DC), favored by Edison. At stake was the basis for the entire nation’s electrical
                        system. Edison launched a campaign against AC, claiming it was dangerous and could kill people; Tesla
                        countered by publicly subjecting himself to 250,000-volt shocks to demonstrate AC’s safety. Ultimately,
                        alternating current won the fight.</li>
                    <li class="p-2">Tesla received his U.S. citizenship in 1891, the same year he invented the Tesla coil. Tesla coils are
                        a type of electrical circuit used to generate low-current, high-voltage electricity. Today, they’re
                        widely used in radios, televisions and other electronics, and can be used for wireless transmission.
                        A coil at Tesla’s experimental station in Colorado Springs, Colorado, created 30-foot sparks that
                        could be seen from 10 miles away.</li>
                    <li class="p-2">Tesla lived in New York City for 60 years, and remnants of his time there still remain. The corner of
                        40th Street and 6th Avenue in downtown Manhattan has been designated “Nikola Tesla Corner” -- with
                        its own street sign -- because of its proximity to Tesla’s laboratory at 8 West 40th Street, where
                        he worked in 1900 while building his now-infamous Tesla Tower on Long Island. At nearby Bryant Park
                        Place, a plaque commemorates the Engineer’s Club, which awarded Tesla the Edison Medal on May 18,
                        1917. During his later years, Tesla fed pigeons in nearby Bryant Park.</li>
                    <li class="p-2">Innovation runs in Tesla’s blood. Tesla once wrote: “My mother was an inventor of the first order and
                        would, I believe, have achieved great things had she not been so remote from modern life and its
                        multi fold opportunities. She invented and constructed all kinds of tools and devices and wove the
                        finest designs from thread which was spun by her.” He credited both his parents’ influence for his
                        success.
                    </li>
                    <li class="p-2">If you couldn’t imagine life without your TV remote, thank Nikola Tesla for making it possible. Tesla
                        invented, predicted or contributed to development of hundreds of technologies that play big parts
                        in our daily lives -- like the remote control, neon and fluorescent lights, wireless transmission,
                        computers, smartphones, laser beams, x-rays, robotics and, of course, alternating current, the basis
                        of our present-day electrical system.</li>
                    <li class="p-2">Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in the Austrian Empire, now Croatia. He was the fourth of five children.
                        After a checkered academic career in Europe, he worked as a telegraph drafter and electrician before
                        moving to the United States to work for Thomas Edison in 1884.</li>
